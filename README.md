This is the first full project I was tasked with in my Computer Science professional certification. The task was to research, brainstorm and build a basic terminal game using Python. 
It was quite a challenge for me as it was the first time I would be coding outside the academy’s platform.

I came up with the idea of building an old school style text based adventure game but with a lot more detail, almost as if you are walking through a book in a sense. I went with the fantasy theme.

The story follows an adventurer (you) who gets trapped in a dark forest under an evil witch's spell, the object is to navigate the forest and locate a staff which can be used to defeat the witch. 
There are items that you can pick up and enemies to be defeated along the way.

The other basic commands are “move”, “pick up”, “inventory” and “quit”.
To navigate I used a system which uses the directions “North”, “South”, “East” and “West”.
I also included combat mechanics for when you encounter an enemy along the way, the combat mechanics make use of the commands “attack” and “flee”.
